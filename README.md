# 🐍 Python Playground

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my **Python Playground** – a personal space where I'm learning and experimenting with Python.  
I'm currently diving into the world of Python programming, and this repository is where I’m:

- 💻 Practicing core Python concepts  
- 🔧 Building small scripts and mini-projects  
- 🧠 Exploring problem-solving with code  
- 🚀 Preparing for future, bigger projects

Whether it’s simple exercises or fun side projects, I’ll be updating this repo as I learn more and grow as a developer.

Stay tuned for more code, chaos, and creativity! 😄
