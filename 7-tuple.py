# A tuple is a collection of items that is:
# 1.Ordered (items have a fixed position)
# 2.Immutable (cannot be changed after creation)
# 3.Allows duplicates
# 4.Can store any data type

# tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1,5)      # tuple template -- tuple = ()
# print(tuple1)
# print(tuple1.index(4))  # to check the first occurrence of an element

# print(tuple1.count(5)) # to check how many time element is there 


# 1.WAP to count the number of students with the "A" grade in the following tuple.

# grades = ("C", "D", "A", "A", "B", "B", "A")   # Tuple with student grades

# count_A = grades.count("A")                   # Counts how many times 'A' appears
# print("Number of students with 'A' grade:", count_A)

# 2. WAP to find the index of the first occurrence of "B" grade in the following tuple.

# grades = ("C", "D", "A", "A", "B", "B", "A")   # Tuple with student grades

# index_B = grades.index("B")                   # Finds the index of first "B"
# print("First occurrence of 'B' grade is at index:", index_B)
